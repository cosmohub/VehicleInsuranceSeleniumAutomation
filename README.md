**VehicleInsuranceSeleniumAutomation**

The project focuses on developing a robust Selenium automation framework. This framework is built using Java, a widely-used programming language known for its versatility and ease of use in automation.
In this project, we have used the Automobile Vehicle Insurance application which is a demo/practice web application offered by Tricentis, designed specifically for learning and practicing automation testing. The demo application mimics real-world functionalities related to automobile vehicle insurance, providing a realistic scenario for testing.
